### Export

#### Export Report

The report is designed for documentation of a CCISS tool session, e.g. as an appendix to a site plan. We recommend including only the site series of interest to the user. Choose the "Feasible Only" option to limit list to species that meet the threshold for inclusion as feasible in any of the time periods.

#### Export data

Feasibility data can be exported for conducting further analysis such as calculating summary statistics for your area of interest. Feasibility data exported from the CCISS tool is in "long form" with each row showing projected feasibility by site of interest, site series, and tree species. A metadata file is included in the export folder.
